# BiMC

This is the official implementation of paper **Enhancing Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Training-Free Bi-Level Modality Calibration (CVPR 2025)**.

## Abstract

Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to adapt to new classes with limited samples, presenting greater difficulties than traditional class-incremental learning. While existing approaches rely heavily on visual models and require additional training during base or incremental phases, we propose a training-free framework that leverages pre-trained visual-language models like CLIP. At the core of our approach is a novel Bi-level Modality Calibration (BiMC) strategy. Our framework initially performs intra-modal calibration, combining LLM-generated fine-grained category descriptions with visual prototypes from the base session to achieve precise classifier estimation. This is further complemented by inter-modal calibration that fuses pre-trained linguistic knowledge with task-specific visual priors to mitigate modality-specific biases. To enhance prediction robustness, we introduce additional metrics and strategies that maximize the utilization of limited data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods.
